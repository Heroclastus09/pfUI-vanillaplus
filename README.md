# pfUI Vanilla Plus

An extension for [pfUI](https://github.com/shagu/pfUI) which adds support for the [Vanilla+ Server](https://vanillaplus.org/).
The latest version of pfUI is required and only enUS-Gameclients are supported at the time.
The modifications are based on the research of [@Heroclastus09](https://github.com/Heroclastus09/) and [@hawaiisa](https://github.com/hawaiisa/).
Many thanks go to Shagu for enabling this practical module and for his support and advice :)
